        1.  `supported_function_most_net`: For questions specifically about the process with the MOST or HIGHEST number of network connections.
        2.  `supported_function_multi_pid`: For questions about applications running with multiple process instances.
        3.  `rag_process_analysis`: For any query asking for a summary, report, or details about a SPECIFIC Process ID (PID). The query MUST contain a number.
        4.  `general_forensics_qna`: For conceptual or definitional questions about the FIELD of memory forensics (e.g., "what is volatility?", "explain a VAD tree"). The query is NOT about the specific data loaded.
        5.  `unsupported_forensics_query`: For questions about the loaded data that do NOT match a supported function. Examples: "which process has the LEAST connections?", "find processes created after 10 PM", "list processes with no network connections".
        6.  `off_topic`: For anything else, including greetings, chit-chat, or questions unrelated to computers or forensics.
